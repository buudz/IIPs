## Simple Summary:
To enhance interoperability and player experience, I propose the introduction of training gyms for Illuvials within Illuvium Zero, allowing for XP growth and a greater sink for elements and Fuel.

## Abstract:
Training gyms will enable both F2P and P2E players to train Illuvials, promoting passive XP gain with some limits for F2P. These gyms will be available for all land tiers, with the highest tier exclusive to Mega City plot holders.

## Overview:
Gyms upgrade levels will affect the number of Illuvials they can train and the speed of XP gains. 
Gyms will operate on a weekly activity basis, with costs scaled by upgrade level and paid in mixed resources.

## Rationale:
This system encourages continuous engagement and investment in the game, providing a scalable way for players to improve their Illuvials. It supports P2E player growth, balancing the gameplay between different player types.

## Details:
Levels: Higher levels allowing more Illuvials and faster training.
Resources: Upgrade costs in all elements and fuels are required to increase the gym level.
Costs: Running costs vary by stage and are required whether spots are filled or not.
Player Types: Different provisions and benefits for P2E players, including exclusive upgrades for Mega City plots.

### Considerations:
Cost vs. Benefit: High setup and maintenance costs might deter lower leveled and lower-tier players initially. Will benefit those that have a focus on team building.
Development time, multi-team coordination and effort would be required to complete.
Post open beta development expected.

## Appendix: 
### The following info offers ideas, suggestions and examples regarding possible size, functions and additional options for interoperability. These suggestions are entirely optional and not mandatory for implementation.

## Gym outline Example:

 Gym name: O’Doyle’s Fight Club

## Structure: 
Size 4x4 with levels 1-5 (structure changes shape/image on the 1st,3rd,5th,7th and 9th upgrade). Only one Gym per single plot and up to nine on Mega city Plots.

## Efficiency: 
100%. Max 150% using additional structures (eg. feedlot and/or rehab zone).

## Upgrade lvl: 
2-8 for all land plots. Level 9 Gym exclusive to Mega City holders.

## Required structures: 
Nexus, Quantum Fabricant.

## Possible additional structures (TBD): 
Feedlot, rehabilitation zone, +++. Instead of power stations, these structures give an efficiency boost to the Gym and perform their own functions.

## Possible additional resources: 
Hero Trainers (Badass Illuvials, Drones, Humans), +++.

## Land Tier production boost: 
Additional XP gain + ressource cost (yield) according to production boost.

## Gym Function:
## Players: 
F2P and P2E place a limited number of unequipped Illuvials for Training providing passive XP growth starting at 50% the speed of average OW XP growth.

## Limits: 
F2P players can train their T0 Illuvials in their own and P2E gyms to an XP cap. Eg- up to 25% required XP for fusion and only ¼ allotment of Gym spots available. 
P2E renters and gym owners can train their unequipped Illuvials and grow XP passively without an XP cap or to max level. ¾ allotment of Gym spots. 

## Running cost: 
Increases proportionately with each upgrade level of the gym(element and fuel sink). Costs are TBD by Labs. 

## Activation: 
Gym needs to be constantly active (weekly by activity clicking) for the Illuvials to gain passive XP. Cost is required whether spots are filled or vacant. This ensures players travel to OW to collect Illuvials to fill Gym with their own or show vacancy sign/advertise their spots for a set fuel fee.

## Gym Fees:  
F2P players if they choose to use P2E Gyms and in-game fuel fee will be required, amount is TBD by Labs. OW P2E players can use gyms for their Illuvials at a Gym set fuel cost. Eg- 1 fuel per Illuvial per 10 levels or per week (TBD by labs).

## Boosts: 
Regions boost Illuvial traits in proportion (TBD by labs). Eg- Shardbluff boosts earth and fire, Halcyon boosts nature and water etc. Land Tier efficiency boosts apply for Gyms.

## Megacity Owners boosts: 
Gym owners on Mega City plots have 50% more spots available compared to single plots. - 100% XP gain factor + Land Tier boosts.

## Optional ideas for interoperability/cross promotion: 
F2P players may get an additional reward with a gift or lend of Illuvials from gym owners for OW, Arena or future games for loyalty or fuel spent on gym access. 

F2P and P2E may be able to borrow high strength Illuvials from gyms for future raids or to help guard against raiders for a set fuel fee. Raiding units could also utilise the Gym and its rehabilitation zone as a “cooldown” post raid. 

Beyond Illuvitar holders may be able to mint Badass Illuvitar trainers in future decks. Eg- Holo Illuvitars could be attached to Gyms and level up with time spent or Illuvials trained and boost stats for Gyms and for points for their Albums.
